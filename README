Building and Installation:

In order to build the website from its sphinx source you will need to
install the sphinx documentation system (http://sphinx.pocoo.org), we
are using version 1.0.6, which relies on the python programming language
(http://www.python.org).

Once those are installed you just cd into the root of the source and
run the command

    	>> make html

The output is in the _build/html directory.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Note for Windows users:

Install GitBash and use it to commit changes to your Git repository.
GitBash comes in handy to run Unix-style commands on a Windows machine,
but it does not come fully equipped with Linux utilities.
Thus, while the previous section explain all that is to be done in order to
build the website from its sphinx source in Unix systems (OSX and Linux),
Windows machines might give you some troubles. Thus, if you are making
changes to the tutorial repository locally on your machine and then
simply try to run
		
		>> make html
		
on GitBash, it will not work, as 'make' will not be recognized as a
valid command. So, what you will need to do is to go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/?source=typ_redirect
and donwload make-4.1-2-without-guile-w32-bin.zip
Extract the zip file and copy its contents to your Git\mingw64 without
overwriting existing files. Then you'll have a working 'make' commands in GitBash.
If you can't locate your Git\mingw64, check in C:\Program Files\Git\
Fore more information, check this excellent explanation https://gist.github.com/evanwill/0207876c3243bbb6863e65ec5dc3f058
and look at forum posts, as well.
